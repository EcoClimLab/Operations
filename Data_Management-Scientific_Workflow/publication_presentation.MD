### Workflow
Current projects use one of three methods for manuscript preparation:
- Markdown & GitHub 
- Word files managed through Dropbox (see below)
- Google Docs 

### Scientific writing guidance
- Following the [Nature summary paragraph structure](https://www.nature.com/documents/nature-summary-paragraph.pdf) produces good abstracts.
- [Ten simple rules for structuring papers](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619) 

### General practices
- Use a reference manager (Zotero, Mendeley, or one that is compatible with both- see [tools](https://github.com/EcoClimLab/Data_Management-Scientific_Workflow/blob/master/tools.md)). Note that manual changes to reference manager fields are lost when references are updated.
